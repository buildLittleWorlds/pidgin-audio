## Lyrics

See doings you no fit talk say we no get
Get why dem dey call us Benin Boys
We no dey make too much noise
Na we dey pull up with convoy
You know the billing wey we dey chest

Many fishes in the river but na you I wan taste
Chop you and clean mouth, eat you for lunch
Have you for dinner, unto the next

See money see am see see see money o
See money see am see see see money o

## Lyrical Analysis

The lyrics of "BENIN BOYS" are a prime example of Nigerian Pidgin English used in contemporary music. They showcase several key aspects of the language and culture:

1. **Pride in Identity**: The line "Get why dem dey call us Benin Boys" directly references the artists' origin and shows pride in their identity.

2. **Boastful Tone**: Phrases like "See doings you no fit talk say we no get" and "You know the billing wey we dey chest" demonstrate a boastful tone common in many hip-hop and afrobeats songs.

3. **Metaphorical Language**: The lyrics use metaphors, especially related to food and consumption, to describe romantic or sexual pursuits. For example, "Many fishes in the river but na you I wan taste" and "Chop you and clean mouth, eat you for lunch".

4. **Wealth References**: The repeated chorus "See money see am see see see money o" is a clear celebration of wealth, a common theme in many popular songs.

5. **Linguistic Flexibility**: The lyrics demonstrate how Nigerian Pidgin can express complex ideas succinctly. For instance, "We no dey make too much noise" effectively communicates the idea of being discreet despite success.

6. **Cultural References**: The mention of "convoy" could be referring to the practice of successful individuals or celebrities traveling with an entourage, which is a status symbol in many parts of Nigeria.

These lyrics, while seemingly simple, pack a lot of cultural significance and demonstrate the expressive power of Nigerian Pidgin English in modern music.
